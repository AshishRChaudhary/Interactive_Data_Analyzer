## 🌐 Live App https://interactivedataanalyzer-pj7jka3j4rwdwt6b9mhkxc.streamlit.app/


Welcome to **Interactive Data Analyzer** — a beginner-friendly **Streamlit** web app crafted to perform essential data analysis without needing any coding knowledge.

Built as a personal learning project to explore Streamlit and refresh my knowledge of **pandas**, the app simplifies exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, and interaction for tabular datasets.

## 🎯 Project Goal

This project was born out of a simple desire:

> "I always wanted a tool that made **front-end interaction for data analysis easier**. Like many, I started with Jupyter Notebooks, but presenting projects in a clean, engaging format felt lacking. Streamlit helped bridge that gap."

The app serves as:

* A **personal learning milestone** to get hands-on with Streamlit
* A **mini data tool** for basic analysis tasks
* A base that can be extended to include **authentication**, **multi-page structure**, or **advanced visualization** in future
